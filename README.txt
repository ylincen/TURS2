Use turs2/run_uci.py & turs2/run_ad_bench.py to see 
- How we run TURS on some dataset, which can be used as an example for using TURS. 
- How we obtain the experiment results; 

============================================================

[Update-2024-05-07]: when running the code inside IDEs like PyCharm or VScode, it may be needed to add the path of TURS2 manually. E.g., FOR MYSELF, it will be

import sys
sys.path.extend(['/Users/yanglincen/projects/TURS'])
sys.path.extend(['/Users/yanglincen/projects/TURS/turs2'])

So, in case you got an error saying "no module named turs2", you can try adding the above code at the beginning of the script (and CHANGING THE DIRECTORIES TO MATCH YOUR LOCAL DIRECTORY).
